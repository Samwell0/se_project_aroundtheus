</br>**📝 Description**
   
This project involves creating an Instagram-esque page consisting of a profile section, content page, and footer, all editable per user creativity. The goal is site responsiveness; it needs to be displayed correctly on various popular screen sizes. 
  
**🎨 Figma**  
  
You can find the link to the project on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1).  
  
**🖼️ Images**  
  
Images are exported directly from Figma, and optimized using [tinify](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster.
